An extension of the neural network tutorial code, where I just try to visualize the interpolation between examples in a Sparse Autoencoder at both input as well as deep representation.

The idea was to inspect the hypothesis presented in the following paper.
@article{bengio2012better,
  title={Better mixing via deep representations},
  author={Bengio, Yoshua and Mesnil, Gr{\'e}goire and Dauphin, Yann and Rifai, Salah},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1207.4404},
  year={2012}
}

Thanks to the rewrite of the [ufldl tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) done by [jperla](https://github.com/jperla/neural).
